# 👋 Hi, I'm Michael Tenorio

> 🎓 Master’s Student in Software Engineering | 💻 Python + SQL Enthusiast | 📍 Auckland, NZ

I'm a hands-on, curious, and creative software engineering student who thrives on solving real-world problems 
through clean code, smart databases, and human-focused design. I used to be the guy fixing database schemas 
in the backend, and configuring the design in front end using a company's dedicated system. 
Now I’m diving headfirst into code, learning how to build full systems — from command-line to cloud.
